## Thesis file repository

## 1. Iterative Branch Exchange - Matlab(v.2024)
The Matlab project uses 2 external programs/libraries.
- Matpower7.0: a free, open-source tool for electric power system simulation and optimization (https://matpower.org/) Run install_matpower.m before.
- Matlab_bgl: a Matlab wrapper for the Boost Graph Library (https://github.com/dgleich/matlab-bgl).

Instructions: Download the [**"IterativeBranchExchange"**](https://github.com/Zecao/ThesisFiles/tree/master/2024_IterativeBranchExchange) .m files. Before starting, edit the file setPath.m adding the folder 'BranchExchange'. The following .m files run the Iterative Branch Exchange for each network described in item 1.
- run_16buses.m
- run_33buses.m
- run_70buses.m
- run_84buses.m
- run_136buses.m

## 2. Iterative Branch Exchange - C# OpenDSS Customization 
Please go to the folder OpenDSSCustomization the repository [**InterativeBranchExchange**](https://github.com/Zecao/IterativeBranchExchange/tree/master) for the C# Visual Studio project. This is the article [**Distribution Network Reconfiguration using Iterative Branch Exchange and Clustering Techniques**](https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/16/5/2395) and contains a 2023 version of the Matlab codes.

[**2024_89_CemigReconfigurationCases**](https://github.com/Zecao/ThesisFiles/tree/master/2024_89_CemigReconfigurationCases)
Folder containing 89 feeders (or substations) in the OpenDSS format (.dss), including the 3 study cases presented in my thesis. Also, I uploaded 4 powerpoints presentations, describing these 89 reconfiguration cases implemented in the CEMIG-D distribution system. I suggest a quick look at these files [**folder "Reconf_pptx"**](https://github.com/Zecao/ThesisFiles/tree/master/2024_SupMaterial/Reconf_pptx)

## 3. Suplementary material
[**folder "2023_LineConstants"**](https://github.com/Zecao/ThesisFiles/tree/master/2024_SupMaterial/2023_LineConstants)
Folder with OpenDSS script for calculating distribution line parameters of my thesis.

[**folder "DSS_reconfiguration_networks"**](https://github.com/Zecao/ThesisFiles/tree/master/2024_SupMaterial/DSS_reconfiguration_networks)
Folder with the 33, 70, 84, 119, and 136-bus networks in Matpower and OpenDSS format.

[**folder "MST_InitalPopulationGA"**](https://github.com/Zecao/ThesisFiles/tree/master/2024_SupMaterial/MST_InitalPopulationGA)
Folder with files (Matlab struct) containing initial population for 33, 70, 84, 119, and 136-bus networks. This population was generated by the Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm and uses binary codification.

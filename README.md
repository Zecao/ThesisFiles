## Thesis file repository

## 1. Iterative Branch Exchange (v.2024)
The Matlab project uses 2 external programs/libraries.
- Matpower7.0: a free, open-source tool for electric power system simulation and optimization (https://matpower.org/) Run install_matpower.m before.
- Matlab_bgl: a Matlab wrapper for the Boost Graph Library (https://github.com/dgleich/matlab-bgl).

Instructions: Download the [**"IterativeBranchExchange"**](https://github.com/Zecao/ThesisFiles/tree/master/2024_IterativeBranchExchange) .m files. Before starting, edit the file setPath.m adding the folder 'BranchExchange'. The following .m files run the Iterative Branch Exchange for each network described in item 1.
- run_16buses.m
- run_33buses.m
- run_70buses.m
- run_84buses.m
- run_136buses.m

## 2. Suplementary material
[**folder "2023_LineConstants"**](https://github.com/Zecao/ThesisFiles/tree/master/2024_SupMaterial/2023_LineConstants)
Folder with OpenDSS script for calculating distribution line parameters of the doctoral thesis.

[**folder "DSS_reconfiguration_networks"**](https://github.com/Zecao/ThesisFiles/tree/master/2024_SupMaterial/DSS_reconfiguration_networks)
Folder with the 33, 70, 84, 119, and 136-bus networks in Matpower and OpenDSS format.

[**folder "MST_InitalPopulationGA"**](https://github.com/Zecao/ThesisFiles/tree/master/2024_SupMaterial/MST_InitalPopulationGA)
Folder with files (Matlab struct) containing initial population for 33, 70, 84, 119, and 136-bus networks. The population was generated by the Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm and uses binary codification.

[**folder "Reconf_pptx"**](https://github.com/Zecao/ThesisFiles/tree/master/2024_SupMaterial/Reconf_pptx)
PowerPoint presentation files describing the 89 reconfigurations implemented in the CEMIG-D distribution system.

# ThesisFiles
Real distribuction feeders files to used in the experiments from my master dissertation(1) and articles(2). The files are Matlab variables (.mat) in the [Matpower](www.pserc.cornell.edu/matpower) struct format. 

1. **directory "2014MasterDissertation"**
In this directory there are 6 real Eletric Distribuction 13,8kV feeders, used to test (and validate) my dissertation algorithm. I decided put the files here, because the dissertation link are no longer available.

2. **directory "2015CitenelArticle"**
In this directory there are the same 6 feeders (maybe be with some minor differences, like temporal differences) plus 6 new feeders.

3. **directory "2019InitialPopulationGA"**
In the *population1* sub directory there are the initial populations for IEEE eletrical tests system for any population/evolutionary metaheuristics. The files are in Matlab (.mat) format and uses binary codification, i.e. they represent the normally closed - NCs (represented by 1s) and normally opened - NOs (represented by 0s) switchs for the following test cases:  
* (Zhu, 2002) 33 buses system
* (Huang, 2002) 69 (or 70) buses system
* (Su & Lee, 2003) 84 buses system
* (Guimarães & Castro, 2005) 136 buses system
* (Ramirez-rosado & Bernal-Agustín, 1998) 417 (or 415) buses system. 
 
The population1 was generated by the Labeling Constructive Algorithm LCA - described in: [A practical codification and its analysis for the generalized reconfiguration problem](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378779612003549) paper.

The population2 was generates by Minimum Spanning Tree based algorithm.
 
 4. **directory "2019_LineConstants"**
 In this directory one can find the OpenDSS script for the calculation of distribution line parameters for my doctorate thesis.
